        #### Dr. Stephen Beckett, University of Maryland (beckett@umd.edu)
        **Welcome** to the simulation exercise section for Day 4 of BSCI439C /    BIOL708F: "Infectious disease dynamics: a systems approach". Well done on opening the second simulation notebook! üôå  

        Recall, the key point in working through this interactive notebook is not in learning how to code, which is challenging and goes beyond what we offer in this course, but to see how concepts we have discussed can be translated into models and simulations -- and the types of characteristics and dynamical outcomes these models describe.

        Do not hesitate to ask Stephen and Gabi questions, we do not want you to get stuck. üßóüößüôã

        There are 2 different model exercises to work through in this interactive notebook. Enjoy!

        ## About this notebook
        This notebook was designed and written using a marimo.io notebook which is coded in python - a general computing programming language. The bonus of marimo is that it can be used as an interactive notebook environment with reactivity! This means that we can use objects such as sliders to change input parameters, that will automatically update outputs - such as figures showing simulation data. This makes the notebook easy to use -- even without needing to learn computer programming! **Remember**, you can download images by right clicking on them, or finding the 'Export output as PNG' in the ... of the appropriate figure cell.

        #1) What's up with a little delay? The SEIR model

        As discussed this week, one of the assumptions built into the differential equation models such as the SIR and SIRS models we studied in week 1 is that rates are characterized by an exponential distribution i.e., $\beta$ the transmission rate describes an average duration of flowing from $S$ to $I$ that follows an exponential distribution -- that is; mechanistically this model suggests that many individuals become near instantly infectious once they are contacted by an infected individual. Conversely, it also suggests some individuals take a very long time for the onset of infection to begin. Clearly this is a few steps away from what we might expect to see in reality for several infectious diseases e.g., respiratory viral infections where we may first expect the virus to proliferate in the host before the host becomes infectious. One method to account for the delay between transmission and infectiousness is to add one (and sometimes more) intermediate compartments. Here, we include one extra compartment $E$ to represent individuals who have been exposed to a disease, but are not yet infectious. The average time spent in the exposed compartment is given by ($1/{\nu}$). In doing so, we **(A)** change the distribution of time that individuals spend on average in the infected stages and **(B)** we change the model to distinguish between infected and infectious individuals. In the below model we will fix the average time between transmission and recovery (time spent in compartments both $E$ and $I$) as: $(1/{\nu}) + (1/{\gamma}) = 10$ days.

        The SEIR model can be written as: 
        $$\begin{align}\frac{dS}{dt} =& -\beta SI \nonumber\\
        \frac{dE}{dt} =& \beta SI - \nu E \nonumber\\
        \frac{dI}{dt} =& \nu E - \gamma I \nonumber\\
        \frac{dR}{dt} =& \gamma I\nonumber\end{align}$$

        and a coded definition is below. Here, with the below slider we can investigate how changing the relative average time spent in the $E$ and $I$ compartments affects disease dynamics.

        #2) The dangers of asymptomatic transmission
        Previously, we have studied models that have had one type of transmission - all infections were considered to act in the same average way. Here, we will extend our model to consider two different types of infections - some infections are associated with symptoms and potentially severe disease that can lead to mortality. Additionally, we may expect symptomatic individuals to take actions e.g., reducing contacts, wearing masks to reduce their ability to transmit a disease onward. On the other hand, some infections may be less severe and have no noticable symptoms: asymptomatic individuals; which may still have the potential to transmit the disease onwards.
        Assembling these elements together, we will:

        - split our Infected ($I$) compartment into two compartments to consider symptomatic ($I_s$) and asymptomatic ($I_a$) infections.
        - consider that symptomatic individuals are aware of their infection and may reduce their transmission rate by a factor of $\delta$.
        - assume that new infections are symptomatic a fraction $p$ of the time, and asymptomatic a fraction $(1-p)$ of the time.
        - that a proportion $f$ of symptomatic infections lead to mortality.

        In doing so, we create a model slightly different than those we have worked previously. Here, flows into one compartment can be routed into two compartments ($E \rightarrow I_a$; and $E \rightarrow I_s$); and we also have flows from two compartments into one compartment ($I_a \rightarrow R$; and $I_s \rightarrow R$). Putting all this together into a model, we find the following set of equations:

        $$\large \begin{align} \frac{dS}{dt} =& \overset{\small transmission}{\overset{\small from\ asymptomatic}{\overbrace{-Œ≤_aSI_a}}}\qquad \overset{\small transmission}{\overset{\small from\ symptomatic}{\overbrace{-Œ≤_s(1-\delta)SI_s}}} \nonumber \\
         \frac{dE}{dt} =& \overset{\small new\ transmission}{\overbrace{S\left(\beta_aI_a + \beta_s(1-\delta)I_s\right)}}  - \overset{\small onset}{\overbrace{\nu E}}  \nonumber \\
         \frac{dI_s}{dt} =& \overset{\small symptomatic\ onset}{\overbrace{(1-p)\nu E}} - \overset{\small loss\ of\ infectiousness}{\overbrace{\gamma_s I_s}}  \nonumber \\
        \frac{dI_a}{dt} =& \overset{\small asymptomatic\ onset}{\overbrace{p\nu E}} - \overset{\small recovery\ from\ I_a}{\overbrace{\gamma_a I_a}}  \nonumber \\
         \frac{dR}{dt} =& \overset{\small recovery\ from\ I_s}{\overbrace{(1-f)\gamma_s I_s}} + \overset{\small recovery\ from\ I_a}{\overbrace{\gamma_a I_a}}  \nonumber  \\

        **core message 1**: asymptomatic transmission can represent a double-edged sword -- each asymptomatic infection is mild and may not lead to severe consequences; but -- asymptomatic individuals may be more likely to transmit infection onwards as they are unaware they are infectious. At a population scale, many more infections can translate into an increase in the number of infections with more severe outcomes.

        **core message 2**: this model represents two transmission pathways - there are two ways to be infecious: either symptomatically, or asymptomatically; and each route is characterised by its own parameters. This introduces a serious complication for our previous understanding of the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0.$ When more than one transmission route is available we have to consider how an infection following each route might contribute to generating new infections. In this model the reproduction numbers associated with an asymptomatic infection are $\large \mathcal{R}_a = \beta_a / \gamma_a$; and for symptomatic infection as: $\large \mathcal{R}_s = \beta_s / \gamma_s$. Putting this together in the full model above we recover the basic reproduction number for the SEIaIsRD model as:

            Further, as $p X + (1-p) X = X$ (when p is between 0 and 1), this result is insensitive to the fraction of new infections that are asymptomatic. With these particular choices of epidemic parameters then, regardless of the choice of p, the epidemic strength is the same, = 3.

            This explains why the above plot showing the proportion of cumulative infections appears flat with respect to p when $\delta = 0.25$. Each of these theoretical epidemics has the same strength, indicating the same number of people become infected, despite the differences in relative numbers flowing through each transmission route, and the consequent differing level of associated severity.

            Note, this also indicates a critical threshold in the dynamics for $\delta$!"""),

            **Note this is a long answer, and considers a lot of details.**.

            When $\delta = 0.25$ contributions to $\mathcal{R}_0$ from the asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission routes are equal (see last question). When $\delta>0.25$ then those with symptomatic infections are taking more actions to reduce their transmission potential; and the contributions from asymptomatic transmission to generating new infections become larger than the corresponding contributions from symptomatic transmission. When $\delta>0.25$ an asymptomatic infection is expected to generate more new infections; whereas when $\delta<0.25$ a symptomatic infection is expected to generate more new infections. This does not mean this is a threshold for there being more asymptomatic infections than symptomatic infections though, which is still governed by the fraction p.

            Another threshold appears at $\delta=0.75$; this is where the contributions to new infections from symptomatic individuals $\Large (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s = 1$. When $\delta >=0.75$ then in an outbreak composed only of symptomatic infection (when p=0) the outbreak has an $\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ and the outbreak cannot take off. We can take this logic further!

           If there is to be an outbreak in this simulation, then $\mathcal{R}_0>1$. Walking through some algebra we find:
            $${\Large \mathcal{R}_0 = \mathcal{R}_a p + (1-\delta)(1-p)\mathcal{R}_s>1}$$
            $${\Large \mathcal{R}_a p + (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s - (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s p>1}$$
            $${\Large (\mathcal{R}_a - (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s) p + (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s >1}$$
            $${\Large (\mathcal{R}_a - (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s) p >1 - (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s}$$
            $${\Large p > \frac{1 - (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s}{(\mathcal{R}_a - (1-\delta)\mathcal{R}_s)}}$$
            Solving with our epidemiological parameter values for $\beta$, $\gamma$ we have a condition for an outbreak, dependent on p and \delta being:
            $${\Large p > \frac{1- 4(1-\delta)}{3 - 4(1-\delta)}}$$
            What happens when $\delta =1$?
            $${\Large p > \frac{1}{3}}$$
            An outbreak will only occur when p>1/3. Check, does this match the simulation output above?

    ## **Note on the basic reproduction number:**

    The SEIaIsRD model has two transmission pathways which means the basic reproduction number cannot be simply calculated as $\beta /\gamma$. If there are characteristically different types of infection with their own properties, then both the relative amount of each type of infection, as well as the expected number of transmission events within the window an infected individual is infectious need to be accounted for.

    The basic reproduction number can also be more complicated when there are multiple ways to leave infected compartments. In all our modeling work so far, we have only considered the effects of a focal disease on population dynamics. What if we consider an additional term to account for all other types of mortality that might be occuring in a population (e.g., traffic accidents, stroke, etc.)? Considering the SEIR model framework, if we assume all-cause mortality is independent of disease status and occurs at rate m, and additionally consider a population birth rate r to balance mortality, we get this set of equations:

    The SEIR model with birth and all-cause mortality can be written as: 
    $$\begin{align}\frac{dS}{dt} =& r -\beta SI - mS \nonumber\\
    \frac{dE}{dt} =& \beta SI - \nu E - mE\nonumber\\
    \frac{dI}{dt} =& \nu E - \gamma I - mI\nonumber\\
    \frac{dR}{dt} =& \gamma I - mR \nonumber\end{align}$$

    Here, some individuals who are infected (move into E) die before they become infectious (I). Additionally, some individuals who are infectious (I) die before they recover. We have to account for these factors in our calculation of $\mathcal{R}_0$ - the average number of expected new infections caused by one infected individual in an otherwise susceptible population. Here:
    $$\Large \mathcal{R}_0 = \overset{\large fraction\ going}{\overset{\large from\ E\rightarrow I}{\overbrace{(\frac{\nu}{\nu + m})}}}\quad.\quad\overset{\large average}{\overset{\large time\ infectious}{\overbrace{(\frac{1}{\gamma + m})}}}.\quad \overset{\large transmission}{\overset{\large rate}{\overbrace{\beta}}}.$$

        You should have gained an understanding of some of the principles behind designing epidemiological models, an appreciation for the richness of dynamics that even these simple epidemiology models can display; how considering the basic and effective reproduction number can help explain the observed dynamics in large populations - and can be helpful to think about how/what interventions might be useful. The utility of these simple models is that we can analyze them and isolate how different flows/interactions might change population-level disease dynamics. This becomes much harder as the system we are considering, and the number of elements and flows, grow. While we have considered several different models, these models do not reflect the full suite of modeling for all infectious disease. Different diseases, and different disease contexts/interventions, have differing characteristics which means they may need particular flows and elements that have not been showcased here. Additionally, there are additional modeling techniques (e.g. network models, agent based models) we did not discuss that could be adopted to model infectious disease spread.
